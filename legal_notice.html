      <h2>1. General Information</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Join (hereinafter referred to as "Website"). This Website is
        operated by three publishers (hereinafter referred to as "we", "us", or
        "our"). <br />

        <br />However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or
        timeliness of the content. <br />
        Use of the content on the Website is at the user's own risk.

      <h2>3. External Links</h2>
      <p>

        responsibility for these external contents.<br />The respective provider
        or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their
        content.<br />
        The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time
        of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of
        linking.<br />
        Permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without
        concrete evidence of a violation of the law.<br />Upon becoming aware of
        legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
